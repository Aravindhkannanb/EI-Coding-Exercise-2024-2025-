## Mars Rover Simulation
## Overview
The Mars Rover Simulation demonstrates the Command design pattern in the context of controlling a Mars rover on a grid-based terrain. It allows for flexible and extensible control over the rover's movements and operations through encapsulated command objects.
## Design Pattern: Command
The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, logs, or operations, and supporting undoable actions. In this simulation, the pattern is used to encapsulate commands like moving forward, turning left, and turning right.
## Structure
The Mars Rover Simulation consists of the following components:
1. __Rover (Receiver)__
   * Represents the rover, maintaining its state and defining operations like moving and turning.
2. __Command (Interface)__
   * Declares the execute method for performing an action on the rover.
3. __Concrete Commands__
   * __MoveCommand__: Moves the rover forward in its current direction.
   * __TurnLeftCommand__: Turns the rover left.
   * __TurnRightCommand__: Turns the rover right.
4. __CommandExecutor (Invoker)__
   * Executes the commands issued to the rover.
5. __Main (Client)__
   * The client creates concrete command objects and uses the CommandExecutor to run them, controlling the rover's behavior on the grid.
## How It Works
   1. The Rover class maintains its current position and direction on the grid and defines the operations it can perform.
   2. Each command encapsulates a specific action for the rover (moving forward, turning left, or turning right).
   3. The CommandExecutor receives commands and executes them in the order they are received.
   4. The client (main program) creates command objects and passes them to the executor to control the rover.
## Key Features
   * __Decoupling__: Separates the object that invokes an operation from the one that performs it, allowing for flexible command execution.
   * __Extensibility__: New commands can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
   * __Uniform Command Execution__: Provides a consistent way to issue commands to the rover, making it easier to extend and manage the control logic.
## Use Case
The Command pattern in the Mars Rover Simulation is particularly useful for:
   * __Remote Control Systems__: Abstracts the command mechanism, making it easier to manage and extend.
   * __Scheduling and Queuing Commands__: Commands can be queued or executed at specific times, supporting more complex control logic.
   * __Building High-Level Operations__: Complex behaviors can be constructed from primitive operations, making the system modular and maintainable.
