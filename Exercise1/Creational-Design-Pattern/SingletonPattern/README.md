# README for Singleton Pattern with Cache Implementation
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton design pattern in Java, utilizing a cache system. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In this implementation, a Cache class is used to store and retrieve objects, demonstrating a basic caching mechanism.

## Components
* __Cache Class__

   The Cache class is designed as a singleton, meaning only one instance of the class can exist at any time. It contains a private cacheMap (a HashMap) to store key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values are objects.
* __User Class__

   A simple class representing a user, containing a name and an age. This class is used to demonstrate storing and retrieving objects from the cache.
## How It Works
1. __Singleton Instance Creation__:

  * The Cache class constructor is private, preventing direct instantiation. The getInstance() method checks if an instance already exists; if not, it creates one. This ensures that only one instance of the cache exists throughout the application's lifecycle.
2. __Cache Operations__:

  * __Put Operation__: The put(String key, Object value) method adds objects to the cache.
  * __Get Operation__: The get(String key) method retrieves objects from the cache based on the provided key.
3. __Demonstration in main()__:

  * The main method demonstrates using the Cache instance to store and retrieve User objects, as well as verifying the singleton nature of the cache by comparing multiple references to it.
## Benefits of the Singleton Pattern
* __Controlled Access__: The Singleton pattern ensures controlled access to the sole instance of the class, preventing multiple instances and ensuring consistent state and behavior.
* __Lazy Initialization__: The instance is created only when it is needed, which can improve performance and reduce resource usage.
* __Global Access Point__: The Singleton pattern provides a single, global access point to the instance, simplifying access to shared resources.
## Common Use Cases
* __Configuration Management__: Storing and accessing application-wide configuration settings.
* __Logging__: Centralized logging services that require a single access point.
* __Resource Management__: Managing connections to resources like databases or file systems
