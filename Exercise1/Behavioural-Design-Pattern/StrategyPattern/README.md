## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Strategy design pattern in Java. The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

## Components
* __Strategy Interface (PaymentStrategy)__

    * An interface defining a method that must be implemented by all concrete strategies to handle payment processing.
* __Concrete Strategies__

   * __CreditCardPayment__: A concrete implementation of the PaymentStrategy interface,             handling payments via credit cards.
   * __PayPalPayment__: Another implementation of the PaymentStrategy interface, handling            payments through PayPal.
* __Context (ShoppingCart)__

   * This class maintains a reference to a PaymentStrategy object and uses this strategy to          perform payment operations. It allows the payment method to be changed at runtime.
## How It Works
1. __Strategy Selection__: The client (main program) sets the desired payment strategy by providing an implementation of the PaymentStrategy interface to the ShoppingCart context.
2. __Payment Execution__: The ShoppingCart uses the set strategy to process the payment when the checkout method is called, thereby executing the strategy's specific payment method.
## Usage
1. __Compilation and Execution__:

   * Compile the Java files using the command:
javac StrategyPatternDemo.java
Run the compiled code with:
Copy code
java StrategyPatternDemo
Expected Output:

The program outputs messages indicating the amount paid using the selected payment method, demonstrating the flexibility of the strategy pattern in switching between different algorithms.
Benefits of the Strategy Pattern
Flexibility: Allows easy switching between different strategies (e.g., different payment methods) without altering the context class.
Scalability: New strategies can be introduced without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
Decoupling: Separates the algorithm's implementation from its usage, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
Common Use Cases
Payment Systems: Handling multiple payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, or digital wallets.
Sorting Algorithms: Switching between different sorting algorithms based on specific criteria or dataset characteristics.
Compression Algorithms: Using different compression techniques like ZIP or GZIP depending on the requirements.
